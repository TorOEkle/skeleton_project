# GraphQL Readme

## Introduction
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST.

In this repo I will have simple examples of how to use Apollo-GraphQL server for demos where I connect to Neo4j.
