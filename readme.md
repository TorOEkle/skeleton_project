# Skeleton Project

This repository is a collection of simple examples demonstrating the use of various technologies including DuckDB, GraphQL, Neo4j, and Dagster.

## DuckDB
DuckDB is an in-process SQL OLAP database management system. It is designed to support analytical query workloads, with a focus on performance and ease of use.

## GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST.

## Neo4j
Neo4j is a graph database management system. It is designed to handle highly connected data and is optimized for querying and managing graph structures.

## Dagster
Dagster is an open-source data orchestrator for machine learning, analytics, and ETL. It helps in building, running, and monitoring data pipelines with a focus on data quality and observability.

Feel free to explore the examples and use them as a reference for your own projects.
